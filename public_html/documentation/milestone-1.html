    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Jacob Hanson is horse trainer with a mare who is looking for a stud to breed her to.
     He is a casual technology user who has limited understanding of dynamic websites and does not
     like technology. He needs a simple static website to look at and easily access our stud's
     information in order to make a decision about breeding, and an easy contact form that makes
     communication with us straightforward.</p>
