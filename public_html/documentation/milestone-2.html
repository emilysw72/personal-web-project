<h2>Content Strategy</h2>
<p>My site will be one page, and will consist of the following.</p>
<p><strong>Sidebar:</strong> A sidebar with an image of our horse. It will have his name on the upper center and a few brief lines detailing his age and winnings.</p>
<p><strong>About Our Stud:</strong> There will be a right-aligned image of our horse with a centered title and left-aligned paragraphs going into detail about him and why he's a good choice for breeding.</p>
<p><strong>Contact Form:</strong> On a different background color to make it stand out will be a contact form that asks for a name, an email address, and a message that will route to our email when submitted.</p>
