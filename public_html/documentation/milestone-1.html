    <h2>Purpose</h2>
    <p>The purpose of my personal web project is to create a brochure for our horse Son Shining Rooster and provide a simple form for interested breeders to contact us about stud fees, availability, or any other questions they might have regarding the horse.</p>
</div>
<div><h2>Audience</h2>
    <p>The intended audience of this website is potential customers who wish to breed their horse(s) with our horse.</p>
</div>
<div>
    <h2>Goal</h2>
    <p>The goal of this website is to advertise our horse and generate interest in breeding with our horse.</p>

    <h2>Persona</h2>
    <p>Jacob Hanson is a horse trainer with a mare who is looking for a stud to breed her to.</p>
    <h3>Devices</h3>
    <ul>
        <li>2001 Dell laptop (Windows XP)</li>
    </ul>
    <h3>Attitudes and Behaviors</h3>
    <p>Jacob is a casual technology user who has limited understanding of dynamic websites and does not like technology.</p>
    <h3>Frustrations and Needs</h3>
    <p>He needs a simple static website to look at and easily access our stud's information in order to make a decision about breeding, and an easy contact form that makes communication with us straightforward. He finds most websites to be too cluttered and confusing, and avoids Facebook for that reason where many owners often advertise their studs.</p>
    <h3>Goal</h3>
    <p>In under 3 minutes, can Jacob parse the website's information and be able to contact us about our horse?</p>
    <h3>User Story</h3>
    <p>As a horse breeder, I want to quickly decide if the stud being advertised is suited to my needs and then contact the owner.</p>
